# browser-workflow
Save the tabs you are currently using, as a pack. Open them when you need it.

**Not tested in other devices. !**

### Basics
- save < workspace > : Saves the urls of the tabs opened in your browser under the name < workspace >.
- < workspace >: Opens all the tabs saved under this name.
  
The list shows all the workspaces with designed URLs.
  
### Example
chmod +x work.py

./work.py

save test (saves all the tabs under the name test)

test (opens all the tabs you saved under this name)
 
### Considerations
Every save overwrites the URLs written before.

Creates a file for every workspace.

 
### TODO 
[ ] Add arguments: (help, list, etc.)

[ ] No need to create a file for every workspace.
